# Converting Heroicons into Rails Partials.

- I utilized version 2.0.18 of [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) to develop this project.
- The reason for making this repository is to transform icons into formats that are appropriate for utilization in Rails projects.
- I created this repository to allow the use of partial SVG files of icons from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) in Rails projects.
- We simplify the usage of [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) by converting them to the correct format.
