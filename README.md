# Conversion of heroicons to rails partials

- I created this project using V2.0.18 of [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
- The purpose of creating this repo is to convert icons into forms suitable for use in rails projects.
- My purpose in creating this repo is to enable partial use of svg files of icons from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) in Rails projects.
- Thus, we make it easier to use by converting [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) to the appropriate format.
